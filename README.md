# hmap
A simple implementation of a hashmap based on Austin Appleby's
[murmur3](https://github.com/aappleby/smhasher) algorithm.
Many thanks to Austin for putting his reference code in the public domain.
I am also placing this implementation in
the public domain using CC0; see [License](#license).

## Introduction

I like to write software and release it to public domain (CC0).
Sometimes I want to use a hash map in my code, and I don't like to have to include their license.
Fortunately, Austin Appleby's excellent murmur3 is in the public domain,
so with a little help from Claude.ai I was able to get this working in a couple hours.

This implementation emphasizes simplicity and clarity over advanced features. For a more full-featured hashmap with an MIT license, see https://github.com/tidwall/hashmap.c.

- Simple, lightweight implementation with no external dependencies
- Uses MurmurHash3 for efficient key hashing
- Supports arbitrary byte arrays as keys (not limited to strings)
- Iterator functionality for traversing all entries
- Public domain (CC0) licensed
- Not thread-safe (by design, for simplicity)

Thanks to Claude.ai for some help with the code and much help with the doc.
See https://blog.geeky-boy.com/2024/12/claude-as-coders-assistant.html for details.


## API

The library uses the "err" system for error handling.
All functions return `ERR_OK` for success or an error object on failure.
See https://github.com/fordsfords/err for details.

There are two sets of write/lookup APIs, one that allows an
arbitrary byte array as the key,
and the other assumes the key is a normal C string.

### Functions

#### `ERR_F hmap_create(hmap_t **rtn_hmap, size_t table_size)`
Creates a new hash map.
- Parameters:
  - `rtn_hmap`: Pointer to store the created hash map
  - `table_size`: Initial size of the hash table (preferably a prime number)
- Returns: `ERR_OK` on success, `HMAP_ERR_PARAM` or `HMAP_ERR_NOMEM` on failure
- Notes: The table size remains fixed; the map does not automatically resize
Choose a table_size that will accomodate expected growth.

#### `ERR_F hmap_delete(hmap_t *hmap)`
Deletes the hash map and frees all associated memory.
- Parameters:
  - `hmap`: The hash map to delete
- Notes: Does not free the values stored in the map; that's the caller's responsibility

#### `ERR_F hmap_write(hmap_t *hmap, const void *key, size_t key_size, void *val)`
Stores a key-value pair in the map.
- Parameters:
  - `hmap`: The hash map
  - `key`: Pointer to the key data
  - `key_size`: Size of the key in bytes
  - `val`: Pointer to the value (only the pointer is stored)
- Notes: 
  - If the key already exists, the value is updated
  - The key is copied, but the value pointer is stored as-is

#### `ERR_F hmap_lookup(hmap_t *hmap, const void *key, size_t key_size, void **rtn_val)`
Retrieves a value from the map.
- Parameters:
  - `hmap`: The hash map
  - `key`: Pointer to the key string
  - `key_size`: Size of the key in bytes
  - `rtn_val`: Pointer to store the found value
- Returns: `ERR_OK` if found, `HMAP_ERR_NOTFOUND` if the key doesn't exist

#### `ERR_F hmap_swrite(hmap_t *hmap, const char *key, void *val)`
Stores a key-value pair in the map. Key must be a C string.
- Parameters:
  - `hmap`: The hash map
  - `key`: Pointer to the key string
  - `val`: Pointer to the value (only the pointer is stored)
- Notes: 
  - If the key already exists, the value is updated
  - The key is copied, but the value pointer is stored as-is

#### `ERR_F hmap_slookup(hmap_t *hmap, const char *key, void **rtn_val)`
Retrieves a value from the map. Key must be a C string.
- Parameters:
  - `hmap`: The hash map
  - `key`: Pointer to the key data
  - `rtn_val`: Pointer to store the found value
- Returns: `ERR_OK` if found, `HMAP_ERR_NOTFOUND` if the key doesn't exist

#### `ERR_F hmap_next(hmap_t *hmap, hmap_entry_t **in_entry)`
Iterates through all entries in the map.
- Parameters:
  - `hmap`: The hash map
  - `in_entry`: Entry pointer (set to NULL to start iteration)
- Notes: Returns entries in arbitrary order based on hash distribution

## Example

See [example.c](example.c).


## Implementation Notes

- Not thread-safe (by design, for simplicity)
- Uses MurmurHash3 algorithm for hash generation
- Collision resolution through chaining (linked lists)
- Fixed-size hash table (no automatic resizing)
- Keys are copied, values are stored by reference


## Development Tips

* bld.sh - builds the test program.
* tst.sh - calls "bld.sh" and runs the test programs.
